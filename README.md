# reworking your workflow

Presentation for RTG conference 2021 workshop on using `rmarkdown` in the context of reproducible research.

The slides are in `reworking your workflow.pdf`. Apologies for them ending up being slightly mangled: they were designed to be presented as html, not as pdf.

If you want to rebuild the slides by yourself, you need to download (or clone) this repository (via the green button `Code`), unzip the the file, open the folder as an Rstudio project, open the file `main_doc.Rmd` in the project and knit the file -- which you should know how to do at the latest after the workshop :)

You may have to install a few additional packages first, but RStudio should help you with that. To increase your chances of success you may want to start with getting the `xaringan` package:

`install.packages("xaringan")`
