- dynamic documents, huh?

--

- what is R markdown and why should we care?

--

- the dark side of a dynamic workflow

--

- let's get our hands dirty

--

- my assumptions:
  
  - you have used `R` before and use RStudio 
  
  - you want to produce pdfs (article, thesis, presentation) or html (presentation, websites, `shiny`)
  
--

- adjust your expectations:
  
  - we scratch on the surface
  
  - always keep in mind what you **need** (and not what you **can do**)

  - fine line between what I would consider a 'good' presentation and showcasing the capabilities of `R` markdown
