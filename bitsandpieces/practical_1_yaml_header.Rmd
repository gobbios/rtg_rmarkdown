## `yaml` header

- contains meta data for the final document (author, title, date)

- determines output format (here: `html_document`)

  - possibly with options (table of contents, highlighting options)
  
  - if we get to it, we might also try `pdf_document`
  
- other options:
  
  - control RStudio's behavior
  
  - bibliography data, reference style
  
  - line numbering and line spacing

- we won't look into this much, and mostly rely on the default options RStudio provides
