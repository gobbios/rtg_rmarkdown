## `R` markdown?

```{css echo=FALSE}
.pull-left65 {
  float: left;
  width: 70%;
}
.pull-right35 {
  float: right;
  width: 35%;
}
.pull-right ~ p {
  clear: both;
}
```

- **markdown** is a programming language for converting plain text into formatted text

--

- **R markdown** builds on this and allows producing formatted output that builds on R code 

--

.pull-left65[
- by now, the `rmarkdown` universe allows production of

  - text documents (journal articles, theses, books) 

  - presentations

  - websites (via blogdown)

  - interactive applications/dashboards (via shiny) 

  - exotic things (epub, docx, pptx, package documentation)
]

## `R` markdown?

- all these have in common:

  - a shared logic and style for mixing written text and results from analyses 
  
  - full reproducibility (at least in theory)

  - being open source and having an active community

  - still a high degree of flexibility
  
  - a certain aesthetic (it just looks good, no?)


---

## `R` markdown!

- self-contained

- reproducible

- robust

- it's what the cool kids do these days (thanks, Roger)

- but there are downsides, too (we'll get to that)

---

## why again?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("decoration_files/reproducibility-cartoon.png")
```
