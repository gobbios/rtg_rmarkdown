## using `R` objects in the actual text part

.XC[

```{r, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
data("cars")
ncars <- nrow(cars)
mycor <- cor(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

The cars data set has `r knitr::inline_expr("ncars")` observations.
And the correlation between speed and distance is `r knitr::inline_expr("round(mycor, 2)")`.
