# Introduction

A short paragraph that contains a summary of the article, for
example the background and some major results. And note that 
the header 'Introduction' was formatted as a header because 
we put a \# in front of it (which is visible only in the source 
code of the document).

Text can be **bold** or in *italics*. 
But we can also use ~~strike through~~.
Underlining is trickier and requires html code.
