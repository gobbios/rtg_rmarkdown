## when does it get complicated?

- it might very well...

--

- actually, it's likely to happen sooner rather than later

--

- long execution time (think bootstraps, models in `stan`)

  - sending workspaces to Roger
  
  - save workspace or not? it depends

--

- collaborators/supervisors/students won't/can't be bothered

--

- (in)dependence of RStudio

--

- environment [R version, package versions] at time of writing (when it works) versus time of production [which is the same as writing but also may be months or years later (reproducibility)]

--

- subtle differences (e.g. this presentation format doesn't support references and only very simple tables)
