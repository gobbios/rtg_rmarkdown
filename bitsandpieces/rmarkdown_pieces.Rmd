## R markdown

- extension of markdown

- allows combining markdown ('text', 'narrative') and `R` ('code')

- still plain text

- independent of $\LaTeX~$ and RStudio (although the latter provides lots of convenience)

- .Rmd

--

.XC[
````
We can combine markdown and `R` code.
Backticks are really important here.

```{r, fig.cap = "My results."}`r ''`
plot(1:10)
```
````
]

## `knitr` (and `rmarkdown`)

- are R packages

- `knitr` takes the code chunks, runs them and 'knits' them back into markdown

- requires R, but its results are independent of R (because they are markdown)

- `rmarkdown` and `knitr` also provide several convenience functions

- independent of `R` and RStudio

## $\LaTeX$

- builds .pdf files (article, thesis, presentation) from .tex files

- "a software system for document preparation"

- "separating presentation from content"

- independent of `R` and RStudio
